# The Second Deliverable
The second deliverable extends the First Deliverable by focusing more on modeling your data. Do not worry if your data is not "perfect" for this part of the project. Your data will never be perfect because you still are not sure what golden nuggets you’ll find within. You will continue to iterate by performing an analysis, finding holes in your data, obtaining more data, performing another analysis, finding more holes, and on and on and on. With that said, while your data does not need to be perfect, it needs to be usable.

## Adjust Deliverable 1 Requirements 
The previous requirements from Deliverable 1 are refined further during this stage of the project. Below, you will find instructions for updating or improving on what you had. Do not just refer me to your Deliverable 1 document. You must type out everything again. Remember, this is your final submission of your project to your manager.

### General Project Information (1 pt.)
Provide the title of the project. Include the names of all the group members.

### Executive Summary (2 pts.)
Update this section to reflect your current state of the project. Do not include the previous version unless nothing has changed.

### Project Schedule, Duration and Estimates (2 pts.)
Provide an updated version of schedule. Include the original schedule. Briefly discuss what caused the changes in your schedule. Also, discuss how your duration and estimates changed. What would you do differently?

### Statement of Scope (2 pts.)
Again, update the scope to reflect your current goals for this project. You do not need to include the original version, just the updated version. Make sure you cover all of the following:
* Project objectives; discuss variables (1 pt.)
* Statement of Scope (1 pt.)

### Data Preparation and Data Dictionary (8 pts.)
More than likely you had to collect additional data and work through ETL. Please explain why you had to collect data. For your new data please give a brief explanation of each step in the process (i.e. Data Access, Data Consolidation, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, and Data Reduction.).

In conjunction with finding new data you need to provide a more refined version of the data dictionary. You do not need to include the previous version.

## Visualizations 
Now that your data is prepared the next step is exploring your data to determine which models are appropriate. Visualizations are a wonderful way to tell a story and explore what models may be appropriate. While you will not engage in any model building this semester, it is always beneficial to keep that in the back of your mind as you develop visualizations.
* Decide on 3 stories you would like to tell with your visualizations. Choose something interesting and compelling. For each visualization, provide a short paragraph introducing the story you are telling. (3 pts.)
* For proposed target variables, create plots and figures to further illustrate its relationship with your predictor variables. For example, a bar chart with your target on the y-axis and one predictor on the x-axis is a start. If you have time-ordered data, explore your data using plots and charts and describe the characteristics of your time series (i.e. trend, seasonal, etc.). (3 pts.) 
* For all other variables, create visualizations where appropriate. (3 pts.)
* Provide a concluding statement for each of your visualizations. What is the take-away? Explain to me what your visualizations tell you about your data. (3 pts.) 

## Descriptive Statistics and Analysis
Now that your data is prepared the next step is exploring your data to determine which models are appropriate. While you do not have to choose a model at this time, this step will provide justification for your model choice in Deliverable 2. Provide descriptive statistics on your data and discuss what you find for the following: 
* Include a table showing the means, medians, standard deviations, maximum, and minimum value for each numeric variable. Do not copy and paste a screenshot from R and Python and paste it into your Word document. (6 pts.)
* Explain to me how your visualizations agree or disagree with the descriptive analysis. (2 pt.) 

## Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis 
Your data should include text, whether from webpages or social media. Using the skills you learned in class, perform a sentiment analysis to determine feelings (i.e. valances, attitudes, and various emotions) related to the problem you are investigating.  
* Assess 4 different emotions/feelings minimum (e.g. happy, sad, angry, glad) (3 pts.)
* Create visualizations for all 4 feelings (3 pts.)
* Generate a classification model for your data (3 pts.)

## Formatting, Style, Grammar and Spelling (16 pts.)
One or two mistakes are expected, but please make sure you proofread your work. Please include a title page, table of contents, label all figures and tables, and maintain clean margins. I want page numbers to start on the page with your executive summary, but not before then. So, your title page and table of contents will have no page numbers; note, page 1 starts on the page with the executive summary, not the title page. Your title page will include a title of your project, the team members of your project, and the date.
